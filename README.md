# Project-Similarity-Analyzer
This website checks the semantic similarity of a project abstract with those in the database
The Search Assistant for Document Similarity Comparison is a sophisticated and intelligent tool designed to empower users in their quest to compare the similarity between user-provided abstracts and pre-existing projects. Harnessing the power of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, this system streamlines the initial processing of input documents by removing stopwords, lemmatizing words, and meticulously extracting pertinent features.

## Key Features

- **NLP-Powered Preprocessing**: The system efficiently preprocesses input documents to ensure optimal analysis, eliminating irrelevant information while retaining crucial elements.

- **TF-IDF Vectorization**: Leveraging the Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) vectorization technique, the system significantly enhances the accuracy of semantic similarity analysis. This results in more precise comparisons.

- **Euclidean Distance Calculation**: To provide users with comprehensive insights, the system employs Euclidean Distance to calculate similarity scores. This metric offers a clear and quantifiable representation of the degree of similarity between documents.

## Use Cases

- **Plagiarism Detection**: Detect similarities and potential instances of plagiarism by comparing user-provided content with existing projects.

- **Content Retrieval**: Quickly find relevant projects or documents by assessing their similarity to your query.

- **Document Clustering**: Organize and categorize documents based on their similarity, facilitating efficient data management and retrieval.
